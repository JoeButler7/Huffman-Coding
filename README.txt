ASSIGNMENT: Project 2
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment

	This program is a data compression program using 
huffman coding. HuffmanSubmit.java contains all of the 
code not given for this project. It contains subclasses
HuffNode to represent a node in the huffman tree and crypt
which is a custim data type to store a character and its frequency. 

To run this code make sure the files you want to compress/decompress
are in the same folder as the src. Navigate to the folder via the 
command line and enter the following commands.

javac *.java
java HuffmanSubmit

NOTE: You will have to change the input/output files in the main method
in huffman submit.java to compress something besides ur.jpg or alice30.txt
